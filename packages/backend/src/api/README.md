These directories contain the API routes for each platform. Within them are `in` and `out` subdirectories.

`in` contains _inbound_ routes -- handlers for requests from the frontend to the backend.

`out` contains _outbound_ routes -- functions which make requests from the backend to the frontend (via websockets).
