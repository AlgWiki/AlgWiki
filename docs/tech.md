# Technologies


## Current

### Language
Both the server and the client are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### State
State management is handled by [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

The directory structure for Redux files follows the [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) proposal.

### View
The frontend is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/).


## Planned
I want to use these once we're ready for them:
- Postgres (database)
- Apollo + GraphQL (server-client communication)
- Redis (temporary storage, eg. for user sessions)
